increments the dictionary (with two elements, the key, value set, where the key (i.e. the hour),
is incremented each time there is an occurrenece. in other words, if there are emails sent 10 times by anyone,
 in that hour, the count of emails sent in "that hour" is incremented.
 However, the "get" function for a dictionary is used to for returning a ZERO, in case that particular "key" or the hour
 is being read for the first time., in which case the get function returns a ZERO, for the first occureence in the for loop.
  This is done in order to avoid the trace error mem overflow
